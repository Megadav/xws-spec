# Obstacle Canonicalization

Since obstacles do not have official names or labels, an arbitrary canonicalization is used.  The general form of canonicalization is of the form `EXPANSION-TYPE-N`, where `EXPANSION` refers to the expansion in which the obstacle is sold, `TYPE` is the type of obstacle, and `N` is a numeric 0-based identifier.
